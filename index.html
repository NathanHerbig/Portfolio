                <p>
                    I’m <strong>Nathaniel Herbig</strong>, a passionate <strong>Game Designer, QA Tester, and 3D Modeler</strong> 
                    with a strong analytical mindset and a deep love for immersive game worlds. 
                    Growing up in <strong>Alaska</strong>, I was surrounded by rugged landscapes, extreme weather, 
                    and the unique challenges of frontier life. My father was a <strong>helicopter pilot</strong>, which gave 
                    me early exposure to aviation, mechanics, and the precision required in high-stakes environments. 
                    These experiences shaped my <strong>attention to detail</strong>, problem-solving skills, and ability to 
                    <strong>analyze complex systems</strong>—traits that I now apply to game design and software testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From a young age, I was drawn to <strong>gaming, mechanics, and design principles</strong>, constantly 
                    experimenting with game mechanics, breaking systems to understand them, and providing 
                    <strong>structured feedback</strong> on game balancing. Over the years, I became an <strong>alpha and beta tester</strong> 
                    for multiple titles, including <strong>PUBG, Lineage 2, Satisfactory, and Civilization 4</strong>, where I helped 
                    stress-test mechanics, balance game economies, and refine combat and movement systems. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My technical background includes <strong>game development, UI/UX feedback, and QA testing</strong>, as well as 
                    <strong>designing and prototyping gameplay mechanics</strong>. I’ve worked with <strong>Figma for UI/UX improvements</strong>, 
                    ensuring that games and software feel smooth and intuitive. My experience with 
                    <strong>GitHub and version control</strong> has allowed me to collaborate effectively on projects, 
                    keeping workflows efficient and structured.
                </p>
                <h3>My Specialties:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Game Design & Mechanics Development:</strong> Balancing, prototyping, and refining gameplay loops.</li>
                    <li><strong>QA Software Testing & Debugging:</strong> Finding exploits, optimizing performance, and stress-testing mechanics.</li>
                    <li><strong>3D Modeling & Animation:</strong> Working in <strong>Blender, Unreal Engine, and Unity</strong> to create immersive worlds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical Scripting & Game Logic:</strong> Implementing systems in <strong>Blueprints (Unreal), C++, and C# (Unity).</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Web & Graphic Design:</strong> Experience with <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Photoshop, and GIMP.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Testing & Iteration:</strong> A structured approach to analyzing and refining game mechanics.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Currently, I’m working on <strong>game prototypes</strong>, including a <strong>multiplayer survival game</strong> 
                    with vehicle-based progression and procedurally generated world encounters. 
                    My design philosophy is rooted in <strong>player agency, rewarding progression, and deep mechanics that evolve over time.</strong> 
                    I believe games should challenge players, give them meaningful choices, and create emergent gameplay experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m always eager to collaborate, refine mechanics, and push projects to their limits. 
                    If you're looking for a <strong>junior game designer, QA tester, or systems analyst</strong>, 
                    let's connect and discuss how I can contribute to your project.
